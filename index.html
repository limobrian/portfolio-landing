            <p>
                    I am a creative designer in the making. My area of specialization will be Web developement and design. One of my values is ensuring I give my clients their money's worth through the delivery of successful and well functioning digital products.
                    I have an eye for details, which is more than resourceful in helping me be keen and efficient in writing my program codes in a professional structure that will give room for later reviews. I am also wellequipped with <span>people skills</span> which has helped me know how to interact with people from all walks of life. I believe that when ,the right opportunity presents itself, I will be a good candidate for the role of providing not only solutions through my technical skills, but also the soft skills that I have gained over time!
